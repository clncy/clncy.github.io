I'm Tom Clancy, a Software Engineer based in Melbourne, Australia :australia:

After studying Electrical & Computer Systems Engineering (ECE) & Mathematics, I began work at Spatial Partners building an automated network design tool to assist the rollout of Australia's [NBN](https://www.nbnco.com.au/). Eventually, my role expanded to include develop solutions for our diverse client base, including:

- A Spatial Data Loading Platform, as well as Identity and Access Management service, for Victoria state government clients
- An IoT platform, providing realtime monitoring of high precision sensors
- An operational efficiency platform, sourcing data from industrial controllers, for a manufacturing client
- Various cloud solutions, applications, and integrations for startups and SMEs in Australia

Eventually, I found myself working on the [IPND](https://www.acma.gov.au/accessing-ipnd) which is the database of record for phone number ownership in Australia - relied upon by emergency services, police and early warning systems. Originally brought on to provide expertise in AWS, to support a migration to the cloud, I now have responsibilities across:

- Cloud Infrastructure and Security
- Monitoring and Alerting
- Software development in Go and Python

It's this project that prompted me to join on at LogicalTech as a Principal Consultant to work fulltime on the IPND.
